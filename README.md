Welcome! This is the source code for *Quasar Factor Analysis*. üòâ

*Quasar Factor Analysis* (QFA) is an unsupervised and probalistic model for quasar spectrum modeling, which can be used for:

* Quasar continuum prediction 
  * High-accuracy and robust due to its unsupervsied nature
  * Reasonable uncertainty quantification
  * Flexible enough to deal with missing pixels
* Physically meaningful spectral embedding
  * One can decompose the quasar emission profile into a few components with exact physical meaning
* Out-of-distribution detection
  * Quasar spectra with interesting features can be selected via QFA thanks to its generative nature

For more details, we refer to

### How QFA works?

QFA generatively models observed quasar spectra and applys the learned model to perform other downstream tasks.

We show the schematic plot of QFA here

#### Model assumption

QFA is build upon two assumptions:

1. Quasar continuum can be modeled as a factor model
```math
  \mathbf{C} = \mu + F\mathbf{h}+\boldsymbol{\Psi}
```

2. The Ly$\alpha$ forest can be approximated as Gaussian random fluctuations
```math
   \boldsymbol{\mathrm{\omega}}(z) \sim\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_\omega)
```

#### Training

#### Continuum Inference

We give an example of continuum inference with QFA here.
